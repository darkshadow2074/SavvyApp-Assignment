# My React Post Application

This is a React application that retrieves a list of posts from an API and allows the user to filter the posts by title or body text.

## Features

- Retrieve posts from API: The application retrieves the list of posts from the API endpoint [https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and stores the data in the application state.

- Render list of posts: The retrieved posts are rendered as a list, displaying the title and body of each post.

- Filter posts: The application provides a search input that allows the user to filter the list of posts based on the title or body text. As the user types in the search input, the list of posts dynamically updates to display only the matching posts.

- Error handling: The application handles errors that may occur during the API request. If an error occurs, an error message is displayed to the user, indicating that something went wrong.
